Hardening Measures
To address these and other potential vulnerabilities:

Input Sanitization: Ensure all user inputs are sanitized both client-side and server-side to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
Strong Authentication and Encryption: Implement strong authentication mechanisms and encrypt sensitive data in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.
Session Management: Use secure, randomly generated session tokens and implement timeout mechanisms.
Validate WebSocket Messages: Treat data received over WebSockets with the same scrutiny as HTTP requests, validating and sanitizing as necessary.
Implement Rate Limiting: To protect against brute force and denial-of-service attacks, implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.
Secure Application Logic: Implement server-side checks to prevent cheating or manipulation of game logic.
Keep Dependencies Updated: Regularly update all third-party libraries to versions that address known vulnerabilities.
Custom ModSecurity Rules: Consider writing custom ModSecurity rules to address the unique aspects of your application, such as specific patterns of abuse or manipulation.
